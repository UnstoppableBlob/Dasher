The controls are WASD to move, and the spacebar lets you dash in the selected direction. You can left click to attack in the direction you are moving in. 
Enemies will chase you if you enter their vision, and attack you if you get close enough. After you kill an enemy, they will drop a letter, and you can pick that letter up by pressing E.
